## Workshop Description ##
Federated querying, an essential technology for the effective and scalable implementation of semantic web technologies, aims to retrieve and integrate data from remote Knowledge Graphs. However, due to the inherent dynamic nature of knowledge graphs, heterogeneity in terms of ontologies and vocabularies used datasets, and the lack of FAIR metadata, federated querying over multiple knowledge graphs remains a challenging task. Therefore, we would like to host a hackathon event to 1) identify challenges regarding writing and executing federated queries, 2) collect practical use cases of federating query across multiple dataset, 3) bring federated query tools to work in the use cases. \
This hackathon will bring together use case providers and providers of federation tools with the goal of defining the "challenges" and use cases of federation engines. Before the hackathon event, three use case providers will prepare the description of the problems and challenges, ensure the datasets are findable and accessible during event, and prepare potential queries that will be used in the hackathon event. The tool providers will test their federation engines or virtual KG integration systems, and provide clear documentation in order to address the challenges brought by the use cases.
