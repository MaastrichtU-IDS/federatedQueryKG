## Workshop Description ##
Federated querying, an essential technology for the effective and scalable implementation of Semantic Web technologies, aims to retrieve and integrate data from remote Knowledge Graphs. However, due to the inherent dynamic nature of knowledge graphs, heterogeneity in terms of ontologies and vocabularies used datasets, and the lack of FAIR metadata, federated querying over multiple knowledge graphs remains a challenging task. Therefore, we would like to host a hackathon event to 1) identify challenges regarding writing and executing federated queries, 2) collect practical use cases of federating query across multiple dataset, 3) bring federated query tools to work in the use cases.

This hackathon will bring together use case providers and providers of federation tools with the goal of defining the "challenges" and use cases of federation engines. Before the hackathon event, three use case providers will prepare the description of the problems and challenges, ensure the datasets are findable and accessible during event, and prepare potential queries that will be used in the hackathon event. The tool providers will test their federation engines or virtual KG integration systems, and provide clear documentation in order to address the challenges brought by the use cases.

## Agenda ##
The agenda is available now in this Github repo - [agenda.md](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/federatedQueryKG/blob/main/agenda.md). We encourage you to fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/ZWWJigFGYeZ3Nsfp7) about your dietary restriction and your willingness to have dinner and social event together.

## Registration ##
The participants have been invited by the organizers. Participants whose participation is funded by the DKG COST Action will receive an official invitation email from the Action and will need to accept that invitation by logging in to the [COST portal](http://e-services.cost.eu/). To this end, they need to create an account at the portal, unless they already have one (which should be the case for all members of working groups of the Action). 


## Practical information ##
The participants are encouraged to book the flights and accommodation by themselves *as soon as possible*. Note that you may also need a visa. Please find the information about visas, transportation, accommodation and meals, and reimbursement below. 


### Visa ###
You may need a Visa or an e-Visa for entering Turkey. The situation may be different based on your nationality and residence permit. Therefore, we strongly suggest you check the links below and apply for the Visa or e-Visa on time. 
- [Visa information](https://www.mfa.gov.tr/general-information-about-turkish-visas.en.mfa)
- [e-Visa application](https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en/) (The website is a bit slow, but it's working.)

If you need an invitation letter in your visa application process, our local organizers from Turkey agreed to write an official signed invitation letter for people in need of a visa or e-visa. In this case, please get in touch with the event organizers. 

### Transportation ###
#### Flights ####
You can fly to [Izmir Adnan Menderes Airport](https://adnanmenderesairport.com/en-EN/). You can check the arrival information from Izmir Airport Website to find the reasonal and economical flights that are leaving from an airport close to your city. You can also use [the flightconnections.com Website](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-to-izmir-adb) to find airports that have direct connections to Izmir.

Since we are planning to start the event in the morning of April 25, it is recommended to arrive the day before.

For participants funded by the COST Action, the allowance for travel expenses is limited to 400€ per person.

#### Transportation in Izmir ####
The visitors arriving from Izmir Adnan Menderes Airport can travel to the event hotel by using a few transportation options:
1. Access by Public Buses: Use bus 202, which departs from the airport, to get there. At the bus, you can purchase the tickets. At the stop labeled “İzmir Mesleki ve Teknik Anadolu Lisesi” you must get off the bus. They will get to the hotel after a three to four minute walk. [Bus timetable](https://www.eshot.gov.tr/en/UlasimSaatleri/289) is available.
2. Access by HAVAŞ Buses: To go to the area where the hotel is situated in Çankaya, you can take private buses named “HAVAŞ” that depart from Izmir Adnan Menderes airport.
3. Access by Metro: From the airport, you can take trains between 05:15 and 23:59. You need to buy İzmirKart at the airport. You must board an Izban train headed in the direction of Aliağa or Menemen and get off at the “HalkaPınar” stop. From HalkaPınar station, you need to switch to Metro in the direction of Fahrettin Altay and get off at the “Çankaya” stop. After a 5- to 6-minute walk, you can get to the hotel.

### Accommodation ###
For participants funded by the COST Action, the expenses for accommodation are included in the daily allowance which is a maximum of 140€ per person per day. Please note that the daily allowance includes your hotel stays and meals. 

The event venue (KORDON hotel) is fully booked now, so we advise the participants to look for other hotels in **Alsancak** as well as the accommodations in **Karsiyaka** and **Bornova** that are close to  tram, metro and ferry stations. For example, here are some possible hotel options: **Gran Via Hotels Alsancak**, **Ontur Hotel**, or **Tanik Hotel**. We do not have agreements or official contacts with these hotels, but participants can book through websites such as Booking.com or Hotels.com.

You can book the hotel via Booking.com, Hotels.com, Air BNB, and other options for alternative accommodation.


### Currency ###
While most places accept debit and credit cards, we suggest having some cash in Turkish Lira with you in case you need it. 

### Reimbursement ###
It is **very important** to sign the attendance sheet every single day when you are in the workshop. This is required for us to get the funding from the COST Action and, for participants reimbursed by that funding, to get their reimbursement.

For participants funded by the COST Action, after the event, you will need to fill a claim form in the COST portal. The claim form will be available after you accept the invitation to this workshop (see above). You will need to fill in your arrival and departure time and upload travel tickets. In contrast to the travel allowance, for claiming the daily allowance (which is also meant to cover your accommodation, in addition to meals) you do *not* need to provide any proof (such as hotel invoice or receipts for meals).

Please read COST Action Travel Reimbursement Rules (from 2022) about what can or cannot be reimbursed by our funder: https://www.cost.eu/uploads/2022/09/Travel-Reimbursement-Rules_March_2022.pdf
